...and description...

Crispy panko-coated chicken, smoky barbecue-spiced potatoes, and easy-peasy steamed broccoli are a pretty obvious recipe for dinnertime success. It‚Äôs got your classic trifecta of meat, potatoes, and veg‚Äîcould you ask for much more? How about a drizzle of hot honey? The stuff combines sweet sensations with spicy good vibrations, making it perfect for taking things beyond ordinary.
