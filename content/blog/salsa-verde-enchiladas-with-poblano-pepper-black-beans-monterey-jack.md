with recipe description from above site below...

Saucy, smothered, hearty, and delicious: this enchilada bake has everything you could possibly want in a recipe. You’ll make it by wrapping tortillas around a filling of poblano pepper, tomato, and beans, then coating the bundles with a healthy glug of mild green salsa and a sprinkle of Monterey Jack cheese. Put it in the oven and let it get piping hot and bubbly, and all you’ll have left to do is add a drizzle of spiced sour cream and dig in to that deliciousness.
